This project was developed by a team of five people in a 24-hour `hackathon` project, for the third and last round of group projects @ <Academia de Código_>'s bootcamp#29, taking place by the end of the 13th week of code learning.

## The project idea
The project began with a challenge: develop a product inspired by a song, “Letter to the free” by Common. This amazing rap was written for the Ava DuVernay-directed film, 13th. Its lyrics reflect with the film’s theme discussing the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime.
Today we have a not so different world. We have other forms of slavery. Have you helped someone recently? Are you free? Have you ever fought for other people´s freedom? Are you comfortable in your own skin? This is some of the questions that we all should think about.
We decided to create a social network where the people can share their outbursts and experiences. But everything in ths social network should point to the theme. So we decide to start with the registration module as our MVP, where the user immerse into an experience that makes him think. By the end we have a profile created.
